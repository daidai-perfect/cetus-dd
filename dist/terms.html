Please carefully read these Terms of Use before using the Site. These Terms (as defined below) apply to any person or entity accessing the Site and by using the Site, you agree to be bound by them. The Terms contain a mandatory individual arbitration and className action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or className actions. If you do not want to be bound by these Terms, you should not access the Site. By using the Site in any capacity, you agree that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the Terms.<br/><br/><div class="term_title__x1smH">1. Overview</div><br/>This Terms of Use Agreement (these &quot;<span>Terms</span>&quot;) covers the www.cetus.zone website, mobile user-interfaces and all its affiliate websites (collectively, the &quot;<span>Site</span>&quot;, including each of its subdomains and web or mobile applications) provided by <span>CETUS TECHNOLOGY LIMITED</span>, a company incorporated or to be incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the &quot;<span>Company</span>&quot;, &quot;<span>we</span>&quot; &quot;<span>our</span>&quot;, or &quot;<span>us</span>&quot;), at times in conjunction with others. As part of the Site, we provide access to the decentralized peer-to-peer finance application (the &quot;<span>Cetus protocol</span>&quot;). The Cetus protocol is a decentralized exchange comprised of certain smart contracts deployed on the Sui and Aptos blockchain networks and related software development kits (collectively, the &quot;<span>Smart Contracts</span>&quot;), which allows traders or liquidity providers to trade Sui-based and Aptos-based tokens or other digital assets (collectively, &quot;<span>Digital Assets</span>&quot;) directly in a peer-to-peer manner via Liquidity Pools (as defined herein). The Cetus protocol is made up of public, open-source or source-available software, including a set of Smart Contracts. Users can interact with the underlying Smart Contracts to create Liquidity Pools, view their Liquidity Pools created or accessed, and interact with other users in Cetus protocol ecosystem. In addition to the Site, you can access the Cetus protocol through a number of third-party web or mobile user-interfaces that we do not own, administer or control (&quot;<span>UIs</span>&quot;).<br/><br/>These Terms apply to you (&quot;<span>you</span>&quot; or &quot;<span>your</span>&quot;) as a user of our Site, including, without limitation, all the products, services, tools and information made available on the Site.<br/><br/>You must be able to form a legally binding contract online either as an individual or on behalf of a legal entity.

We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to our Terms.

Changes are binding on users of the Site and will take effect immediately upon posting. As a user, you agree to be bound by any changes, variations, or modifications to our Terms and your continued use of the Site shall constitute acceptance of any such changes, revisions, variations, or modifications. By continuing to use the Site, you also acknowledge and agree that we have provided you with sufficient notice of such changes.<br/><br/><div class="term_title__x1smH">2.

For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to access the Smart Contract, the Site or the Services does not necessarily mean that same (or your activities through it) are legal under the laws, regulations or directives relevant to your jurisdiction.<br/><br/><div class="term_title__x1smH">3. The Site and transactions on the relevant Blockchain Network</div><br/>Transactions that take place via the visual user interface on the Site are confirmed via the relevant Blockchain Network. You understand that your public address on the relevant Blockchain Network will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Site.<br/><br/>Cetus protocol is a non-custodial protocol, therefore the Site does not hold or control your digital assets. Any digital assets which you may acquire through the usage of the Site will be held and administered solely by you through your selected electronic wallet, and we shall have no access to or responsibility in regard to such electronic wallet or digital asset held therein. It is solely your responsibility to select the wallet service provider to use in connection with the Site, and your use of such electronic wallet will be subject to the governing terms of use or privacy policy of the provider of such wallet. We neither own nor control your selected electronic wallet service, Google Chrome, any electronic wallet, the relevant Blockchain Network, or any other third party site, product, or service that you might access, visit, or use for the purpose of enabling you to use the various features of the Cetus protocol. We will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any such third parties, nor will we be liable for any damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any other interaction with any such third parties.<br/><br/>The Company will not create any hosted wallet for you or otherwise custody digital assets on your behalf, and it is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of your selected electronic wallet. In the event that you lose access to your electronic wallet, private key(s), password(s), or other method(s) of securing your wallet, all digital assets held in such wallet may be irretrievable, and the Company will be unable to assist you in any way. You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against the Company, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to your use of any wallet software, associated loss of digital assets, transaction failures, or any other defects that arise in the course of your use of your electronic wallet, including any losses that may obtain as a result of any failure of any Smart Contracts or the Site.<br/><br/>The Company reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of the Site with or without notice. You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of all or any part of the Site.<br/><br/>The publicly deployed Smart Contracts you interact with are experimental in nature and you should not utilise the Smart Contracts or Liquidity Pools for deployment of any substantial amount of digital assets.<br/><br/>We reserve the right to disable access to the Site or the interface at any time in the event of any breach of the Terms, including without limitation, if we, in our sole discretion, believe that you, at any time, fail to satisfy the eligibility requirements set forth in the Terms. Further, we reserve the right to limit or restrict access to the Site by any person or entity, or within any geographic area or legal jurisdiction, at any time and at our sole discretion. We will not be liable to you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Site being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason.<br/><br/>By interacting with Cetus protocol, users are agreeing to be bound by the governance process for the holders of the Cetus governance token (the &quot;<span>Community</span>&quot;), and enter into mutual covenants and/or obligations with other holders of Cetus governance tokens inter se. Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, the parameters for Liquidity Pools on Cetus protocol, composition of digital assets, reference/oracle pricing, as well as distribution of treasury fees or rewards to participants of the Community would be determined by said Community governance process. Users agree to accept the outcome of this governance process as legally binding and valid, and shall waive any rights to challenge these outcomes before any court of law, tribunal or regulatory authority.<br/><br/><div class="term_title__x1smH">4. Services</div><br/>The Company has deployed the Smart Contracts on the relevant Blockchain Network for users to utilise in accordance with these Terms. Users may directly call the functions of the Smart Contracts directly, or access them via the user interface provided by the Site.<br/><br/>Cetus protocol allows users to trade digital asset pairs directly in a peer-to-peer manner. Users will be able to act as market makers for these transactions by staking/pooling their digital assets into decentralised liquidity pools (&quot;<span>Liquidity Pools</span>&quot;) to provide the necessary liquidity for transactions by other users. These digital assets may comprise various fungible cryptocurrencies in the market.<br/><br/>Liquidity Pools and the underlying digital asset pairings will be selected and created by liquidity providers, who allow other users to access these Liquidity Pools to conduct trades. All trades conducted via Cetus protocol would be performed in a non-custodial manner and users remain in control of their digital assets.<br/><br/>Further, Cetus protocol functions as an intermediary user interface connecting users with projects which intend to launch their own token sale projects via the Cetus protocol and Liquidity Pools. The Company does not actively introduce users to such projects or vice versa. Further, the Company does not act as a fiduciary or custodian in relation to any funds which you may place with a project, and any claim relating to these funds are solely against the relevant third party issuer for the project which bears sole responsibility for such funds.<br/><br/>All interactions between liquidity providers and traders on Cetus protocol operate in a peer-to-peer manner. Liquidity providers and traders on Cetus protocol enter into a direct contractual relationship via the autonomous Smart Contracts and/or other smart contracts deployed by various other third party networks, and therefore liquidity providers wholly assume all responsibility towards the user of the Liquidity Pools. There is no further control by or interaction with the Company (or the relevant affiliate) which had deployed the Smart Contract(s). The Company and its affiliates shall in no circumstances be construed as a party to said peer-to-peer direct contractual relationship, is not liable for performance of obligations thereunder, nor does it bear any financial or commercial risk or provide any warranties or assurances in connection with the same.<br/><br/>The Site merely provides a visual user interface allowing users to interact with Liquidity Pools and to access liquidity provided by liquidity providers, and does not act as an agent for any of the users. Although the Site is intended to display accurate and timely information regarding Liquidity Pools and possible swaps, the Site or relevant tools/information may not always be entirely accurate, complete or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. The pricing information data provided through the Site does not represent an offer, a solicitation of an offer, or any advice regarding, or recommendation to enter into, a transaction with the Company or the Site. Accordingly, users should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or tools/information tools are at the sole responsibility of each user. Notwithstanding any of the other provisions in these Terms, any photographs, graphic illustrations, videos, models, charts, designs, or examples on the site are strictly for information purposes only and have no contractual value nor do they form the basis of any contract with the Company.<br/><br/>Neither the Company nor the Site provides any digital asset exchange or portfolio/fund management services in connection with the Liquidity Pools. If you choose to engage in transactions with liquidity providers in Liquidity Pools or any other users, then such decisions and transactions and any consequences flowing therefrom are your sole responsibility. In no event shall the Company, its affiliates or their respective directors or employees be responsible or liable to you or anyone else, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising from or relating to any interaction or continued interaction with Liquidity Pools, or reliance on any information provided on the Site (including, without limitation, directly or indirectly resulting from errors in, omissions of or alterations to any such information).<br/><br/><span>THE SITE SOLELY FUNCTIONS AS A VISUAL USER INTERFACE. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE COMPANY, THE SMART CONTRACTS, OR THE SITE BE CONSTRUED AS A DIGITAL ASSET EXCHANGE, BROKER, DEALER, FUND MANAGER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, EXCHANGE, CUSTODIAN, ROBO-ADVISOR, INTERMEDIARY, OR CREDITOR. THE SITE DOES FACILITATE OR ARRANGE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH A LIQUIDITY POOL, WHICH TRANSACTIONS OCCUR ON THE RELEVANT BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK. THE COMPANY IS NOT A COUNTERPARTY TO ANY TRANSACTION FACILITATED BY THE SMART CONTRACTS OR THE SITE OR FOR ANY USER OF THE SITE. NEITHER THE SMART CONTRACTS OR THE SITE PROVIDES FINANCIAL ADVISORY, LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR TAX SERVICES DIRECTLY, INDIRECTLY, IMPLICITLY, OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER, AND YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY CONTENT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE POSTED ON THE SITE TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER ADVICE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT SUPPORT OR ENDORSE ANY LIQUIDITY POOL CREATED BY ANY USER OF CETUS PROTOCOL, AND EACH SUCH CREATOR IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENT WITH NO EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY.</span><br/><br/>The Company reserves the right to suspend or terminate access to the Site or the Smart Contracts by any creator of Liquidity Pools or user of Liquidity Pools for any reason whatsoever (including without limitation for a breach of these Terms). You agree that the Company will not be liable to you or to any third party for any suspension or termination of any user.<br/><br/>Access to the Smart Contracts or the Site may become degraded or unavailable during times of significant volatility or volume. This could result in the inability to interact with third-party services for periods of time and may also lead to support response time delays. The Company cannot guarantee that the Smart Contracts or the Site will be available without interruption and neither do we guarantee that requests to interact with third-party services will be successful.<br/><br/><div class="term_title__x1smH">5. Fees and Payment</div><br/>If you elect to interact with Liquidity Pools, all transactions will be conducted solely through the relevant Blockchain Network. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Site, or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the relevant Blockchain Network.<br/><br/>The relevant Blockchain Network typically requires the payment of a transaction fee (a &quot;<span>Gas Fee</span>&quot;) for every transaction that occurs on the relevant Blockchain Network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralised network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Smart Contracts.<br/><br/>You may be subject to certain additional fees and commissions, including fees imposed by creators of Liquidity Pools for accessing and utilising the Liquidity Pools as notified to you prior to engaging with any digital asset swap or liquidity provision. The Company also reserves the right to levy additional fees for access via the Smart Contracts or the Site in the future. You agree to promptly pay all aforementioned fees and commissions.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, &quot;<span>Taxes</span>&quot;) associated with your use of the Site or the Smart Contracts (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership or transfer of digital assets or interaction with any Liquidity Pool, or relating to Cetus protocol).<br/><br/><div class="term_title__x1smH">6. Access / Disclaimer of Warranties</div><br/>ACCESS TO THIS SITE AND THE PRODUCTS HEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN &#x27;AS IS&#x27; AND &#x27;AS AVAILABLE&#x27; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

From time to time, access may be interrupted, suspended or restricted, including because of a fault, error or unforeseen circumstances or because we are carrying out planned maintenance or changes.<br/><br/>We reserve the right to limit the availability of the site to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction in our sole discretion and/or to terminate your access to and use of the site, at any time and in our sole discretion. We may suspend or disable your access to the Site for any reason and in our sole discretion, including for any intentional or unintentional breaches of these Terms. We may remove or amend the content of the Site at any time. Some of the content may be out of date at any given time and we are under no obligation to update or revise it. We do not promise or guarantee that the Site, or any content on it, will be free from errors or omissions.<br/><br/>We will not be liable to you for any issue, loss or damage you may or have suffered as a result of the Site being unavailable at any time for any reason. You will comply with all applicable domestic and international laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the site (&quot;<span>Applicable Laws</span>&quot;).<br/><br/>As a condition to accessing or using the Site, you agree and represent that you will:<br/><br/><ul><li>Only use the Services and the Site for lawful purposes and in adherence with these Terms;</li><li>Ensure that all information that you provide on the Site is current, complete, and accurate; and</li><li>Maintain the security, privacy and confidentiality of access to your Digital Asset wallet address.</li></ul><br/>As a condition to accessing or using the Site or the Services, you will not:<br/><br/><ul><li>Violate any Applicable Law, including, without limitation, any relevant and applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing and sanctions laws and any relevant and applicable privacy, secrecy and data protection laws.</li><li>Use the Site for any purpose or conduct that is directly or indirectly unlawful;</li><li>Export, reexport, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any technology belonging to us or the Cetus protocol in violation of applicable export laws or regulations;</li><li>Infringe on or misappropriate any contract, intellectual property or other third-party right, or commit a tort while using the Site;</li><li>Misrepresent, with omission or otherwise, the truthfulness, sourcing or reliability of any content on the Site;</li><li>Use the Site in any manner that could interfere with, disrupt, negatively affect, redirect or inhibit other users from fully enjoying the Site or the Cetus protocol, or that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the functioning of the Site or the Cetus protocol in any manner;</li><li>Attempt to circumvent or disable any content filtering techniques or security measures that Cetus employs on the Site, or attempt to access any service or area of the Site that you are not authorized to access;</li><li>Introduce or use any malware, virus, Trojan horse, worm, logic bomb, drop-dead device, backdoor, shutdown mechanism or other harmful material into the Site;</li><li>Post content or communications on the Site that are, in our sole discretion, libelous, defamatory, profane, obscene, pornographic, sexually explicit, indecent, lewd, vulgar, suggestive, harassing, hateful, threatening, offensive, discriminatory, bigoted, abusive, inflammatory, fraudulent, deceptive or otherwise objectionable;</li><li>To the extent applicable, post content on the Site containing unsolicited promotions, commercial messages or any chain messages or user content designed to deceive, induce or trick the user of the Site; or</li><li>Encourage or induce any third party to engage in any of the activities prohibited under these Terms.</li></ul><br/>You acknowledge that the Site and your use of the Site present certain risks, including without limitation the following risks:<br/><br/><ul><li>Losses while digital assets are being supplied to the Cetus protocol and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity pool. Prices of digital currencies, tokens and/or other digital assets fluctuate day by day or even minute by minute. The value of your available balance could surge or drop suddenly. Please note that there is a possibility that the price of tokens could decrease to zero. Prices of tokens are prone to significant fluctuations, for example, due to announced proposed legislative acts, governmental restrictions, news related to cyber crimes or other factors causing potentially excessive market enthusiasm, disproportionate loss in confidence, or manipulation by others in the market.</li><li>Risks associated with accessing the Cetus protocol through third party UIs. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on those UIs to understand and accept the risks that use entails. You are also responsible for doing your own diligence on those interfaces to understand and accept any fees that those interfaces may charge.</li><li>You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any interaction with Liquidity Pools and the underlying digital assets. You accept all consequences of participating in such interactions, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All decisions to interact with Liquidity Pools are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, the Company accepts no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with any interaction with Liquidity Pools and the underlying digital assets. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Smart Contracts or the Site be deemed to create a relationship that includes any management of any assets, or the provision or tendering of investment advice.</li><li>Risks associated with any Smart Contracts with which you interact.</li><li>No creator of Liquidity Pools will be able to guarantee the future performance of digital assets held in a Liquidity Pool, any specific level of performance, the success of any strategy or your overall results from interacting with Liquidity Pools. When reviewing the information, portfolio, performance, opinions of these creators, do not assume that such party is unbiased, independent or qualified to provide financial information or opinions. Past performance and risk scores have many inherent limitations and are not indicative of future results. No representation or guarantee is being made that any creator of Liquidity Pools will or is likely to achieve gains or losses similar to the past performance. The actual percentage gains or losses experienced by users will vary depending on many factors.</li><li>Although we do not have access to your assets, you are reminded and acknowledge that at any time, your access to your Digital Assets through third-party Digital Asset wallet services, unrelated to the Site, may be suspended or terminated or there may be a delay in your access or use of your Digital Assets, which may result in the Digital Assets diminishing in value or you being unable to complete a Smart Contract.</li><li>You are reminded of the inherent risks with digital assets and decentralized finance including the fact that tokens are not legal tender and are not backed by any government. Unlike fiat currencies, which are regulated and backed by local governments and central banks, tokens are based only on technology and user consensus, which means that in cases of manipulations or market panic, central governments will not take any corrective actions or measures to achieve stability, maintain liquidity or protect their value. There is a possibility that certain transactions cannot be settled or may be difficult to settle, or can be completed only at significantly adverse prices depending on the market situation and/or market volume. Transactions may be irreversible, and, accordingly, potential losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions are not recoverable. Some blockchain transactions are deemed to be completed when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time when you or another party initiated the transaction.</li><li>The regulatory frameworks applicable to blockchain transactions in connection with tokens are still developing and evolving. It is possible that your transactions or funds are, or may be in the future, subject to various reporting, tax or other liabilities and obligations.
